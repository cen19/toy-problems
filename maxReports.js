// rank soldiers thing

// soldiers can only report to people one rank higher than themselves
// such as a solider of rank 3 can report to a rank 4 but that's it, they cannot report a rank 5 or higher, if there is no rank 4 officer, a rank 3 soldier has no one to report to

// soldiers of the same rank only report to one person in the rank above them
// such as if the case of [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]
// there would only be 3 reports because there are three rank 3s and they will only report to a rank 4
